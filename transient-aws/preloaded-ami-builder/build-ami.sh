This script will create a new AMI and preload it with CDH parcels to speed up
bootstrapping time for Cloudera Director. You must supply the ID of a CentOS
or RHEL 6.4-6.6 AMI to use as a base for the preloaded AMI.

Additionally, you must ensure AWS credentials are available in the environment
for this to work properly. Please refer to Packer's documentation here:
https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon-ebs.html.

Extra packer options can be provided in the PACKER_VARS environment variable
prior to executing this script.

Usage: $0 <aws-region> <ami> <name> [parcel-url] [repository-url]

  <aws-region>:  The AWS region that you want the new AMI to be housed on.
  <ami>:         The AMI you want to use as a base.
  <name>:        A descriptive name for the new AMI.
  [parcel-url]:  Optional parcel URL to use for preloading.
                 Defaults to http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/parcels/5.7/
  [repository-url]:  Optional Cloudera Manager yum repository URL to use for preloading.
                     Defaults to http://archive.cloudera.com/cm5/redhat/6/x86_64/cm/
